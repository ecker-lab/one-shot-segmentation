## The Role of Data for One-Shot Semantic Segmentation

We found a mistake in the assignment of categories to the dataset splits. Therefore, the scores reported in the paper are wrong and should not be used. 
You can find a corrected version of the paper [in this repository](The_Role_of_Data_for_One_Shot_Semantic_Segmentation.pdf).
